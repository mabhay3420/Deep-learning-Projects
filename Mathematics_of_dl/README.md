# Mathematics of Deep Learning

I followed a lot of colab tutorials for implementing standard models using PyTorch and Tensorflow. This was helpfull in getting me acquainted with higher level concepts of Deep learning. In other words, for simple applications, I can figure out which steps need to be taken and I can then change the hyperparameters to get the best result and so on....

But I still don't feel i know things.... And I figured out why.Because I don't know mathematics behind the algorithms.( Or Should , I say this might be the first step in Understanding the Vast Universe I set out to explore on my own....and yeah...I like to philosiphize things).

I am reading [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) and the plan is to implement ( at least a basic version) mathematical algorithms/concepts discussed in it using python and only libraries such as numpy for simple matrix manipulation task which do not hide the actual details. According to time availability, I will attach a mathematical description of the algorithm with the code. I was inspired by awesome [ml-from-scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch).

Well, There is no rush to do complete this project in 1 year or 2 year. Honestly Should we aim to complete things or just do things....( Note to my future self ).
