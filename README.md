# Deep Learning assignments

## Summer
Contains Assignments and practice notebooks implemented in PyTorch and TensorFlow.The work was completed in summer 2020 under the PClub Project "Introduction to ANN" which was loosely based on "Deep learning with Andrew Ng"
>This mainly covers:  
>>* Single layer neural networks  
>>>- linear regression models  
>>>- pyTorch Tutorials
>>
>>* DNN  
>>* CNN  
>>* Recurrence neural networks ( A small portion of NLP is implemented)
    

## PClub-hackathon
This will(?) contain the notebooks implemented for the PClub's "Deep Learning Hackathon Series".
> Notebooks  
>>Transfer Learning
